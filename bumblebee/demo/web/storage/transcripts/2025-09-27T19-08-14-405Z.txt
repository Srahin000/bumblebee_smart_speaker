Transcription: Can you tell me? Tell me about Egypt?
Response: Ooh, Egypt! That's a super interesting place! 🌍 Did you know they have giant pyramids there? They're like huge triangle buildings made of stone! And they have a big, long river called the Nile. It's so important for the people there.

Do you want to hear about the pharaohs? They were like the kings and queens of ancient Egypt! They wore amazing crowns and had lots of treasures. 👑
